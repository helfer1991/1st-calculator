# 1st-calculator

### First project (calculator) made using html, CSS and Javascript (vanilla).
My main goal with this project was to practice CSS grid and DOM manipulation. Moreover, since I'm learning OOP in college (even though in Java, not JS), I tried to employ that programming paradigm to this project.
In fact, in class when my teacher was explaining to us how this paradigm worked and the main differences between OOP and procedural/imperative programming, it became clear to me that making a calculator would be a great way of practicing DOM manipulation (especially event listeners suck as 'click') along with OOP.

Tons of research had to be made to develop this project, particularly looking at some tutorials to solve some problems that I faced, but in the end I'm happpy to realize that I have expanded my skills!

On a side note, I had to downsize this project to the 4 main operations, but my goal is to further expand this calculator (possibly with a different design) to accommodate more operations, such as trigonometric ones, exponentials and a couple more.
